// term, not an operator, which keeps a query like `cats and dogs` meaning what
// a user typed rather than what the grammar would prefer.
//
// Parentheses are single characters and need no surrounding space. A double
// quote opens a phrase that runs to the next double quote; the contents are
// kept verbatim, including any AND or OR inside them.
//
